But if Black peeps there now, White could ignore and push Black down around B or C.]LB[pb:A][pf:C][pg:B];B[pg];W[ob]C[This is slow, White could've just played A last move and it would've been more efficient.]LB[pb:A];B[me]C[Why now? Because without this stone, when White comes in at A soon enough, Black doesn't have a great answer.]LB[kc:A];W[qi];B[ql];W[rg];B[qg];W[rf];B[pe];W[re]LB[oi:B][rg:A]C[Instead of A, White could've also just come out at B. The White group would be hard to attack. Hajin is happy with sente here.];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo]LB[cq:A]C[Hajin didn't like A and wanted to make something in the center instead. It's not obvious how.];W[cn];B[ip];W[iq];B[jp];W[hp];B[ho];W[jq];B[kp];W[lq];B[mo];W[mq];B[pi]C[This is a strong move. A and B were also considered.

At this point, Hajin is saying it'd be a real shame if she lost the center.

Hajin's happy with the profit in the bottom right corner. Now she's weak and is looking at B or C.]LB[nk:A][np:B][oo:C];B[oo];W[lo]LB[lp:A]C[Disconnecting at A isn't right for making the most of her influence.];B[mn]C[Hajin's saying White should extend at A here because the stone at B isn't worth much.]LB[lm:A][lo:B];W[ln];B[lm];W[ml];B[lp];W[lj];B[km]LB[ll:A]C[Better than A.];W[mh]C[White is safe now.];B[bg]C[Now that her moyo is gone, she's looking for ways to make territory.];W[kf];B[kd];W[go];B[gp]C[Why? Because she felt like it, and there's not much potential in the center.];W[gn];B[fn];W[gm];B[fm];W[io];B[cl]LB[gl:A]C[She thought about making the exchange at A first.];W[jn];B[kn]C[There was no guarantee that playing in the bottom left was sente.];W[dl];B[dm];W[cm];B[ck];W[em]C["White's shape is a little weak, but I'll have to be very careful"];B[do];W[dn];B[dq]C["Ugh, my shape is a little bit ugly"];W[ep];B[cp];W[co];B[eq];W[cq];B[bp];W[eo];B[cr];W[fp]C[Seems like an even exchange.];B[dk];W[eg];B[eh];W[fg];B[ff];W[dh];B[cg];W[db];B[fl]C[She had given the 3 stones up, but since White ignored A, saving them is now big.]LB[dk:A];W[gq];B[el];W[gc];B[hc];W[gb];B[hb];W[fb]LB[gc:A]C[She couldn't capture A, so gave up her 2 stones. This was big for White.];B[lg]C[Fighting spirit, finding a good trade. She starts counting now.];W[nf]C[Sente];B[mg];W[ng];B[rh]C[It's amazing how she can count and play on autopilot at the same time...];W[kh]C["Oh. Is that a good move?"

She realized mid-count that A was a good move by White, and adjusted while figuring that out in byo-yomi.]LB[kh:A];B[hh];W[hj];B[gj];W[gk];B[fj];W[hi];B[gh];W[ih];B[ig];W[jh]C[This is small.

Big areas are A, B, and C.]LB[gr:B][nb:A][nr:C];B[nb];W[nc];B[nd];W[oc];B[mb]C[Now A is really big. Hajin notices her weakness at B and wonders if the bottom right was bigger to protect against a wedge.]LB[no:B][oe:A];W[oe];B[nr];W[mr];B[nq]C[White runs out of time.])
