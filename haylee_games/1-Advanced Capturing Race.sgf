Read out the cut at X but decided it's more important not to be trapped.]MA[kq];W[mn];B[nm]LB[pl:B][qq:A]C[She thinks about if making the exchange at A is reasonable. Since she didn't think an invasion at B was likely, she thought it was worth doing now.];W[qq];B[rp];W[kq]C[W group is kind of weak, so no this is urgent.];B[lo];W[mp];B[jq];W[kr];B[jp];W[lr];B[ec]C[She considers the kosumi, but it's too slow. Pincer is more active.]LB[de:A];W[gd];B[de];W[dd];B[ed];W[ee];B[df];W[ef]C[I had difficulty following how she decided on this push.

She cut at A because she wanted to cut, she felt it was the right strategy.

B was considered as an alternative move to this push.]LB[dd:A][fe:B];B[be];W[bd];B[dg];W[db];B[eb]LB[dc:A][gb:B]C[Her candidate moves were A and B.

She decided that if she played B, W would play A, and she didn't like how the capturing race looked for her.];W[dc];B[hc];W[jc]C[Her intuition said that the push at A was an overplay since she had weaknesses in her shape.]MA[ee][ef][gd]LB[gc:A];B[hd];W[gf];B[he];W[ge]C[She points out her corner is a ko, but close to alive.];B[ib];W[dj]MA[fh][fi]C[She also considered a move like this, but thought that if Black played on the side, it wouldn't leave her group with many prospects.];B[fh];W[hf]LB[ei:A]MA[fh]C[She thinks Black would've been happier coming out at A instead. Her opinion is that Black's shape is a little thin.];B[bg];W[jf]C[She pointed out that Black playing A suggested he was eyeing the corner, but since she had sente at B, it basically should be fine.]LB[bg:A][ea:B];B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[lb];B[gc];W[ea]MA[gc]C[Black's move at X was sente, but she can defend in sente.];B[fa];W[da];B[gb];W[bi]C[This prevents Black from playing around X.

She also considered A. But a monkey jump would ruin her territory potential.]MA[bj]LB[ci:A];B[di];W[ci]C[Not sente, but Black's group is kind of weak, so she expects a response.];B[dh];W[ej];B[hh];W[cn];B[je];W[ke];B[jd];W[kf]MA[lc]C[She realizes there's a cutting point to keep an eye on.];B[fq];W[qh];B[ph];W[qi];B[pi]C["I can live, right...?"];W[qj];B[qg];W[ql];B[pk];W[rm];B[qk];W[rk];B[rh];W[si];B[ri];W[rj];B[rf];W[qn];B[pm]C["What? Can you do that?"];W[po];B[pp];W[oo]C[No choice.];B[qo];W[pn];B[rn];W[sn];B[ro];W[pl];B[om]C[Now she reads out whether the capturing race works for her.];W[qm];B[ol];W[sh];B[rg];W[sl];B[sj];W[rq];B[so];W[sm]C["Phew"];B[qc];W[pc];B[qd]C[Seems like the game is basically over.];W[jh]C[Hajin decides it's a good chance to count to make sure she's actually ahead while her opponent's byo yomis ran out.

She thinks the losing idea was the tsuke at X, he should've just blocked and taken a territory hit.]MA[ph])
