A is possible - safe, but submissive, but not necessarily bad.
B is more tempting.]LB[oh:B][rf:A];W[oh];B[of];W[od];B[nd];W[nc];B[ne];W[mc];B[rd];W[rc];B[qe];W[pd]C["I wonder if Black is trying to capture these 2. It will be very difficult"]MA[oh][qh];B[rj];W[mh];B[rh]C["That's too small... I can also cut here, but do I want to?"]LB[pg:A];W[pg]C["Seems like a good option"];B[qg]LB[pf:A][qi:B]C[Before playing at A, Hajin thinks about making an exchange at B first, but decides there's ultimately no need. Why? Because she can play it at any time, but if  Black plays it first, she can ignore it.];W[pf];B[nh]C["This is a very surprising move, but that doesn't mean I can answer it any way, I should be careful"];W[ng];B[ni];W[lg];B[og];W[nf];B[oe];W[pe];B[oi];W[ph]C["Awww, that was so terrible. Now, these Black stones are dead and there's this thing too.... yeah, that was really bad."]MA[nd][ne][oe][of][og]LB[ri:A];B[mi]C["This one I don't even need to answer"

This is an interesting view into Hajin's thought process. She is still worried about the hane at A. If Black plays the hane at A, then White connects at B, then Black can hane again at C. She doesn't like this shape for White. So, she decides to play at C first.]LB[kg:C][lh:A][mg:B];W[kg];B[lh];W[mg]C[If White had played the hane at A, in response to Black B, it would've just given Black a wall to attack the stones on the bottom.]LB[li:A][mi:B]MA[mm][mn][mp][no][op];B[lo];W[mo];B[km]C["Now I have to live inside"

If White plays at A, Black will play at B, and that's no good. So B is the right place to play first.]LB[pq:B][qq:A];W[pq]C[The Black territory in the X-area isn't small, but Black doesn't have a ton elsewhere. White can also kill the 4 triangle-stones by playing the hane at A.]TR[qe][qf][qg][rd]MA[qm]LB[ri:A];B[qq];W[qr];B[rr];W[pr]C[According to Hajin, White is now safe.

Hajin talks about disliking Black's strategy of playing the hane at A in the fuseki. It gave some center power and points on the side, but in gote.
