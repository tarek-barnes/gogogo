X is quite weak and White has a way to connect at A.]LB[lq:A]MA[mp];B[do];W[dl]C[Hajin said she didn't want to tsuke at A because it'd give Black too much center influence]LB[co:A];B[eq]C[She thinks about A and B. A would be easy for both sides, so she plays B. It also helps she has help nearby.]LB[ep:B][er:A][jp:C];W[ep];B[dp];W[fq];B[er];W[cq];B[fr]C[A and B are her candidate moves. She sees A as more of a compromise, taking the two stones and letting Black meander into the bottom. B is more complicated. She says she wants to make things complicated because of her stone at C.]MA[do][dp]LB[eo:A][fp:B][jp:C];W[fp]C[Black could make an exchange at A. Seems like that's what she would've played.]LB[bp:A];B[gq]C[This was an insightful moment.

Hajin looks at A, then wonders if it's actually a good exchange, and pulls back. Then she looks at B, but doesn't like White's easy response at C, she'd gave to push through, atari, atari, then atari again to come out up towards her stone at D. This all weakens her stone at E. So given all that, she decides on A then B.]LB[bo:B][dl:D][go:C][gp:A][jp:E];W[gp];B[hq];W[bo];B[hp];W[fn]LB[gn:A]C[This is the proper move, though A was another one she considered.];B[ho];W[gn]C[Hajin was looking at A as well. This move leaves a weakness at B, which she's concerned by, but thinks since the Black stones are weak, should be manageable. Black immediately plays there... "awww"]MA[do][dp]LB[em:B][en:A];B[em];W[fk];B[bn];W[bp];B[ck];W[cn];B[cm];W[dm];B[dn]C[Hajin thought through this quite quickly. She wondered if this means if White connects at A, that Black is proposing Black B - White C - Black D - White E, giving White the left side and Black some center influence.

Ultimately, she decides it feels a bit like an overplay and demonstrates by turning at F.]LB[cl:F][dj:E][dk:C][ek:D][el:B][en:A];W[cl];B[co];W[bl];B[gl];W[fl];B[fm];W[gm];B[el]C[She verifies that a ladder to capture Black's stone at A would work. If not, she'd play White C, but can now play White B to fatten that pig up.]LB[ek:B][en:C][gl:A];W[ek]C[Black resigns here.])
