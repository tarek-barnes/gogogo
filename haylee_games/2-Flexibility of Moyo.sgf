(;GM[1]FF[4]CA[UTF-8]AP[Sabaki:0.51.1]KM[5.5]SZ[19]DT[2025-07-01]C[Hajin is White];B[dp];W[qd];B[ed];W[pq];B[kd];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[de];W[bf]C[Since the ladder is good for Black];B[cc];W[bd];B[cg]C["He should be coming to the corner...oh no!"];W[dc];B[ec];W[db];B[dd];W[cb]LB[eb:A]C[She could've also exchanged at A, but wasn't sure];B[od];W[pf]C[She comments on the left side... there's an open door at A and a cut at B, and her territory is solid, so she's happy with her result]LB[cf:B][eb:A];B[qc];W[rc];B[of]C[She points out that this strategy is ...interesting. Normally when Black plays A, they want to cut at B, taking the corner and giving White the center. But then the exchange from X contradicts that idea, no?]LB[of:A][rd:B]MA[qc];W[og];B[nf];W[pg];B[pc];W[rb]C[She thinks about if this is big enough. Answer: yes. Big cash, hard to resist.];B[kp]LB[mh:A]C[She expected Black to play around A];W[qn]C[She thought about playing at A instead, but wanted to make the most of her influence on the right side.]LB[mq:A]MA[og][pf][pg];B[pr]C[She points out that this seems early for Black to play. Seems like she quickly considered extending or playing a hane. She thought playing the hane at C would lead to a cut at A, so she decided A was the best reply.]LB[oq:A][or:C][qq:B][qr:D];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr]C[She is grossed out by Black's crawling. "That's so terrible. Why does he want to keep doing that? He's damaging his own..."];W[mq];B[qq];W[qp];B[rq]C[Her sente. A and B are candidate moves. If White C, Black D, and she thinks it's better not to make that exchange.]LB[ip:A][mh:B][rp:C][sp:D];W[ip];B[mr];W[kq];B[jq];W[jp];B[lq];W[lp];B[kr];W[ko];B[pp];W[kq];B[qo]LB[lr:A][pn:B]C[She is tempted to take at A, but then thinks Black has a good response with the tiger mouth at B.];W[pn]C[She's thinking about ko threats. Black will likely take at A, but does she need to respond locally? Unsure.]LB[kp:A];B[kp];W[ng]LB[mp:A]C[She's not thrilled about the ko fight. Worst case, she can just give up her 4 stones and it won't be the end of the world.];B[mp];W[kq];B[qe]LB[lr:A][rd:B]C[Which is bigger?];W[pe];B[kp];W[lo]C[She wonders if she's given too much up. Maybe. But White has good potential in the center, and because she played at A, she's looking at a deep invasion like B that might've been unlocked.]LB[md:B][pe:A];B[op];W[md];B[nd];W[mf];B[mc];W[me];B[lc];W[no];B[np];W[jf];B[pd];W[rd];B[kg];W[kf];B[lg];W[jg]C[Black invaded quite deeply, but she points out that it's hard to attack these stones.]MA[kg][lg];B[nm]C[She thinks this means Black was concerned about a ladder.];W[nn];B[om];W[po]C[She thought about something like A instead, but after potential exchanges around B and C, it could leave her groups too weak.]LB[mo:B][oo:C][pl:A];B[jh];W[ih];B[ji];W[ii];B[jj]C[She's not sure how to attack.];W[id]C[So let's see what Black does. A looks like it could be sente.]LB[jc:A];B[ij]C["Argh, really?" He has a weak group that he's not taking care of.]MA[ce][cg][dd][de][ec][ed];W[gi];B[gk]C["Seriously, you're not worried? You should be"];W[di];B[lf];W[gd]C[Hajin is annoyed that he's prioritizing A over B.

Maybe he's trying to attack C with a move like X?]LB[dd:B][jh:A][nn:C]MA[ql];B[gb]C["What is your plan? Are you seriously trying to live in there?"];W[hc];B[hb];W[ib];B[jc];W[ic]C[Hajin wonders how Black will manage. She thinks it's possible for Black's A group to live, but he'll have to make a lot of painful exchanges. She wonders if she can get B in sente. Black's C group will be quite weak then.]LB[dd:A][le:B][mc:C];B[fi];W[fh];B[eh]C["Wait a minute, what's going on?"];W[ei];B[fj]C["I guess he's claiming that I'm not alive yet either, which is fair..."];W[eg];B[dh]C[Hajin wonders if she should've extended at A instead.]LB[fg:A];W[ci];B[fg];W[gh]LB[eb:B][eg:A]C[So Black will capture the stone at A, and Hajin will get to play B, then it turns into a capturing race.];B[ff];W[fe]C[She wants to make this exchange first.

But then she realizes that Black can't make an eye at the top, even if he plays first, so maybe a move around A or B is better.]LB[gf:A][hf:B];B[ef];W[gf]C["I am quite alive, and he is not"

Hajin realizes she forgot to read something out. If Black plays at A, normally she'd want to hane at B. But with this shape, she's concerned about Black playing a hane at C, as well as a block at D and a keima at E. It all just makes the situation complicated, and so her previous assumption about Black not being able to make an eye may not hold anymore.]LB[bb:C][bg:D][dk:E][eb:A][ha:B];B[eb];W[le]C["Oh well. Let's try this one"];B[ke];W[mg];B[bh]C["Whoops. I think that one was a mistake"];W[cf]C["He should have known that there was a cut"];B[df];W[ch];B[dg];W[bg];B[bi]C["Huh?? What is he doing?"];W[bj];B[cj];W[ah];B[jb]LB[ha:A]C[She thinks Black could've played at A, which served the same purpose but with less aji.];W[li];B[kh]C[Hajin says that although she didn't get to capture anything, Black didn't gain anything, so she should be fine.];W[hj];B[hk];W[gg]C[Hajin wanted to peep at A, but realized her group would be in trouble with B and C. However, maybe playing at C would've been better for her, she says.]LB[gg:B][gj:C][il:A];B[lm];W[kl];B[km];W[jl];B[jm];W[il];B[im];W[hl];B[hm];W[gl]C[No choice. If Black plays at A, she's not sure how to respond.]LB[ql:A];B[fl];W[gm];B[ho];W[ml]C[It seemed like she wanted to  play around A or B, since Black didn't, and wanted to exchange a quick peep first, but Black decided to be difficult.]LB[pl:B][ql:A];B[ll];W[lk];B[mk];W[nk]C["I don't want him to be cutting at A in sente, so I'll do this one"]LB[kk:A];B[mj];W[lj];B[ik];W[gn];B[nl];W[en]C[Hajin points out that she's no longer so concerned with playing around A because Black is making his B group bigger.]LB[jh:B][ql:A];B[dm];W[dn];B[cn];W[co]C[Hajin doesn't think Black can cut at A.]LB[do:A];B[bn]LB[em:A]C[She says A is probably sente, but doesn't think it's a good exchange for her.];W[do];B[bo];W[cp]C["It's not a bad deal to get the corner, Black will have to come back and live"];B[bp];W[cq];B[mi];W[mh];B[oj];W[ck]C[Black not answering in this area is so big.];B[cl];W[ek];B[el]LB[fk:A]C[Black could've also played at A, since White can't cut --  there's an atari and snapback.];W[dk];B[kk];W[lh]C["Now what are you going to do? There is a cut and no eye"];B[fk];W[bl]C["Phew. So it seems like the game is over with this."];B[fo];W[go];B[gp];W[fp];B[fq];W[ep];B[bq];W[cr];B[eq];W[dq];B[bm]C["Oh come on, that's not even sente"];W[br];B[al];W[bk];B[he];W[ie];B[hi];W[hh]C[Hajin is wondering how to respond when Black connects at A. B or C?

While she is thinking about it, Black resigns.

Ultimately, she decides C is better, because losing the marked stones wouldn't change the outcome.]LB[hp:A][qj:C][qk:B]MA[ip][jp][ko][lo][lp][nn][no][pn][po][qn])
